Make the board size dynamic and create it automatically.

Create the snake automatically at a random point on the left part of the board.

Place a random fruit at a random position where the snake is not.

Make it impossible for the snake to go the opposite direction of where it is currently going.
And making it possible to execute two moves in quick succession.
- Checking if the directon is in the opposite of the current direction.
- Setting a boolean 'move_made' to false, making it impossible to change direction again before the snake has moved.
- If a direction change is attempted before the snake has moved, this direction is saved in a variable 'next_move'
  and is used to set the direction in the next gameloop (if the direction is legal)
This can be tested by turning on info mode and moving in two directions before pressing space.

- Make welcome screen with app.state = 'welcome'
- Ability to change difficulty by customizing speed and board size on welcome screen with arrow keys.
  (Bold text on option being changed)

- Make gameover screen with app.state = 'gameover'
- Make it possible to restart from gameover screen and keep settings while doing so,
  but still generate new board and snake position. Uses the same funtion as when changing settings (change_settings(app))
- Make it possible to go back to welcome screen from gaveomver

- Add images for fruit and 3 different types of fruit
- Make alternating squares have light or dark green, same as google's snake game

- Add highscore in a text file, only 1 score is saved, no leaderboard :(
